== Simple Saml Client

I am using this app as a platform to learn how to use
{omniauth/omniauth-saml}[https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-saml]
to authenticate users with a SAML Identity Provider.

So feel free to look, but some of the code will be specific to
my fumbling-about-playground environment.

Also note - in my playground I'm running this app at port 3001

    rails s -p 3001

And my IdP apps at port 3000.
